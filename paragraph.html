   <div class="p1"> <h3>Use and Abuse of Internet</h3><br>
<p>The process of coordinating two or more computers with cable, modem, satellite, etc. is called the internet. To get the necessary information, one needs to search Yahoo or Goggle. The Internet has a lot of importance. It plays an effective role in the field of trade and commerce. It has a huge potentiality for the significant improvement of economic and productivity. In Bangladesh, also, in the production of goods and services both in government and private sectors, it has used economic potentiality. At present, internet-based e-commerce has become very popular all over the world. It also plays an important role in the field of education. Students and teachers can easily get the necessary information through the internet. They can read any books without going to the library. Not only students and teachers but also businesspersons, economists, doctors, politicians, and other professionals can be benefited by the internet. The benefits of the Internet are inescapable. Not to say, it has the same abuse too. Now a day's especially teenagers are very prone to absorb the demerits of the internet. They sometimes keep chatting and whiling away their time with their friends or even unknown persons, when they are supposed to be at their desk to study. The importance of the internet is vast. However, the use of the internet in our country is very expensive. Our government should take the necessary steps to manage easy access to the internet for the people of Bangladesh.</p></div>
<div class="p1"> <h3>The Life of a Farmer <sub><i>-Md Saifullah</i></sub></h3><br>
  <p>A man who works in his fields or other people’s fields for leading his life and family is called a farmer. He has a small hut of his own or he lives in another people’s house. He usually lives from hand to mouth. He is a laborious and strong-bodied man. He shifts his labor to others for earning or leading of his life. Every day he gets up early in the morning. Then he takes his birth and takes some stale rice or breakfast with stale carry or some vegetables. After completing his meal he goes to his field to grow crops and plants. Though he has no field of his own he works others field like his own and grows much crop. Several times he works from morning to afternoon in the field. Sometimes he works morning to midnight if he cannot complete his daily work or he has much work.  He gets his wages at the end of his work or at the end of the day. Then he goes to market to buy his daily goods and he returns home. Usually he wears old and dirty cloths. He has no power to buy new clothes for him and his family members. The income of a farmer is not too high to continue his life comfortably and happily. His life is full of sorrow and suffering. When he finds no work at that time he and his family pass their time without eating. He lives below poverty line. He looks older than his age. When he is unable to feed his family members properly at that time his wife is bound to work in other houses or institutions as a house made. He and his family lead a sorrowful and miserable life. He has no ambitious and hope. He wants to eat and feed his family normally. As a result they suffer a lot from nutrition and a lot of dieses. He is unable to educate his children due to acute poverty and for his illiterate. In spite of his unhappy life he feels happy because he leads an honest life.</p></div>

  <div class="p1"> <h3>Unemployment Problem in Bangladesh<sub><i>-Md Saifullah</i></sub></h3><br>
    <p>Unemployment means the state of being without any work both for the educated and the uneducated for earning one’s livelihood. This problem has become a great concern all over the world. But nowhere in the world this problem is so acute as in Bangladesh. Thousands of people in our country are without any job. At present the toughest task for any young man is to manage a job. It is tedious and sometimes humiliating. A person has to run year after year from office to office to find out a job. Hundreds of candidates swarm over a single post. The bad effect of unemployment is not only confined to the economic field but also destroys the sense of moral values for want of employment. Many young people become frustrated. They have to lead a vagabond life. They have to idle away their time. Life becomes a curse and burden to them. When there is no dim ray of hope, they resort to commit different types of crimes like hijacking, plundering, robbery, murder, terrorism, drug addicting etc.</p><p>
      There are many reasons behind unemployment problem. Our country is over populated. The rapid growth of population is the main reason of unemployment problem. Job facilities are very small in proportion to the growth of propagation. And this increasing number of population outpaces all development of the country.</p><p>
      Our county is industrially very much backward. In fact the development in this field is very slow. Cottage industries have almost decayed. The few mills, factories and industries that we have can only absorb a limited number of people.</p><p>
      Most of the people of our country depend on agriculture. But our cultivable land is very limited. So, it can not engage a huge number of people. Moreover, this profession is seasonal. So, the farmers have to sit idle for a few months a year. Our present system of education instead of giving any solution, creates educated unemployed young men. In our educational system there is no much scope of giving vocational training and technical education to a student. So after taking the highest degree even from the highest seat of learning, they remain unemployment.</p>
      Our educated young men generally think it to be disgraceful to do any manual work. They prefer service to any kind of business. This false sense of dignity and prestige is one of the reasons of their being unemployment.</p><p>
       In order to eradicate this problem we have to mobilize all our energies to this great purpose without wasting time. The most essential measure is the industrialization of our country. A large number of mills, factories and industries should be set up where many of our unemployed youths will get the opportunity to work.</p><p>
      A great change should be brought our education system. More importance should be given on professional, vocational and technical education. This will make an opening to work in different industrial sectors both home and abroad.</p><p>
      The educated youth should change their attitude to life. They must learn to choose independent career. They can work in agriculture field, cultivate fish, and grow vegetables. They can start small business. In fact self employment is a possible solution to this great problem.</p><p>
      Steps should be taken to set up co-operative farming, cottage industries and open new system of public work in the rural areas to create job for the village people.</p><p>
      Bangladesh earns a handsome amount of foreign currencies by exporting manpower. This has solved this problem to a little extent. If proper measure is taken, their number can easily be increased. But no attempt will bear any fruit unless effective measures are taken to keep the population growth under control.</p><p>
      Unemployment is a great curse to a nation. We cannot expect the development of our country leaving its millions of people unemployed to survive as a boastful nation. We should make all out efforts to get rid of this curse.
